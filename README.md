# MIDIHero

Simple JUCE project plugin which reads inputs from a Guitar Hero controller using HIDAPI and translates to MIDI output.

Provides simple GUI that allows user to map MIDI notes to guitar buttons. At this time, only supports Guitar Hero 5 controller (PlayStation).

In-progress. Planned features include:
- Better GUI
- Support for other MIDI events besides notes
- Actions for other buttons on a controller (whammy, strum, start/select buttons)
- Support for more controllers
